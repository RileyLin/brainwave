# Brainwave Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels icon
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels icon
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels icon

These icons are used in the browser's toolbar, extensions page, and Chrome Web Store.

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable design that works well at small sizes
- Make sure the icon is visible against both light and dark backgrounds
- Maintain consistent branding with the main Brainwave application
- Use PNG format with transparency

For actual deployment, you should replace this file with actual icon files.
